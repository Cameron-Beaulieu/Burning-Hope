### Project Details
Burning Hope is a fast paced 2D platformer, where you take on the role of the mysterious adventurer GR on his explortation through North Peak Cave. Shrouded in darkness, the player must use their a single torch and a few sticks to illuminate their surroundings and complete challenging platforming to their attempt to escape. 

This project was developed by Cameron Beaulieu, [Marc kevin Quijalvo](https://github.com/mkevinq), and [Callum Kipin](https://github.com/c-kip) as part of CISC 226 - Games Design at Queen's University during winter 2021.
### Game Synopsis
In Burning Hope, your goal is to escape the confines of a cave system which you have become trapped in. To do so, you must navigate a series of increasingly challenging platforming segments using the limited light sources available to you. Due to the darkness of the caves, these light sources will be required for the successful navigation of the depths. With your reliable torch, a few spares, and your nimble platforming abilities you must find an exit before becoming lost to the caves forever.


## Rules
- ASD to move left, down, right respectively
- Spacebar to jump
  - You get one jump off the ground/wall and a second jump while in mid air
  - Second jump resets when you touch the ground or a wall
- Left click to throw a torch
- Right click to dash (the dash directions, i.e. holding W and D while dashing makes your dash up and to the right at a 45 degree angle)
- Red Braziers are checkpoints, touch them to light them (they act as respawn points)
- R to reset to your last checkpoint (start of level if you have not reached a checkpoint)
- Mine Mechanics (area 2)
  - Ropes can be lit by touching them or throwing a torch at them. They will illuminate the area around them until they burn out
  - Blue Braziers can be lit by touching them or throwing a torch at them. Once lit, they destroy certain portions of the wall in the level, opening secret paths
- Cult Mechanics (area 3)
  - Projectiles are spawned by red projectile runes. These projectiles kill the player on contact
  - The Magic Light follows your cursor and will destroy all projectils that collide with it, as well as illuminating the surrounding area
